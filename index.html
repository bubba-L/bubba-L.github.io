            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Gina Piccirilli and I am a game design and development major at RIT. 
                I have experience working in C#, Java and JavaFx, HTML and CSS, as well as various 
                design and programming softwares.</p>

                <p>Although I only started coding a few years ago, I am not suprised that I ended up in 
                this field as I have always loved being creative and solving problems, even if there 
                wasn't actually a problem to begin with. As a child I would always have an idea for a 
                new invention or art project, such as making a robot out of legos, painting on anything 
                I could, or even just taping batteries together and using a bent paper clip to turn on a 
                light bulb. As I grew up I would constantly find new ways to create, from robotics and 
                CAD to woodworking or jewelry making. </p>
                
                <p>When I first took a coding class, I instantly became passionate about programming, eager 
                to learn more so that I could add to and advance my projects. I am not one to be afraid 
                to ask for help, so I was constantly asking my professor for extra resources or when I 
                needed help debugging. Learning about all of the oppertunities this field could bring me 
                has inspired me to take this route, including learning about companies that use game development 
                skills to create technologies that help improve people's lives. As I progress in this field, 
                I aspire to gain as much experience as I can, putting what I learn - both in programming 
                and design - together into something I am proud of. I have many goals, small and large, 
                that I work towards every day.
                </p>

            <h2>Minerva's Marvelous Mixturette </h2>
            <h3>January - May 2024</h3>
            <p>Minerva's Marvelous Mixturette is a keyboard-controlled cooking game. 
                You play as Minerva, a witch running a small potion business out of a carriage. 
                The goal is to serve customers their orders as quickly and accurately as possible. </p>
                <p>This game was made in MonoGame by Witch Works - a group of four students including 
                    myself - for the course Game Development and Algorithm Problem Solving II, and was worked on 
                    throughout the semester.</p>
                <p>My main focuses included working on the file I/O, loading in level information and 
                    saving/showing the highest scores for each level. I also worked specifically on the 
                    UI of the score and level select screens, as well as writing, balancing, and playtesting 
                    the levels. The whole group contributed to planning, documentation, code oragnization, 
                    and basic functions of gameplay.</p>

            <h2>Rose from the Dead</h2>
            <h3>January - May 2024</h3>
            <p>Rose from the Dead is a 2D platformer game whose story features 
                Carrik - the playable character - whose village depends on flowers that give
                holder different abilities. These flowers are dying and her village is defenseless
                without them, so Carrik is determined to find out what is causing them to die.</p>
                <p>This project was made throughout a semester for the course 2D Animation and Asset Production.
                    The game was made using Unity's 2D platformer template, with all of the art, 
                    assets, and animations made by me, along with a title cutscene animation.
                    For this project I used a combination of Procreate, Adobe PhotoShop and AfterEffects, Krita,
                    Unity, and Davinchi Resolve.</p>

            <h2>Fruit Ninja Remake </h2>
            <h3>September - October 2024</h3>
            <p>This game is a replication of the popular game “Fruit Ninja”, with different food items as the 
                fruit and an angry-looking fish as the bombs. The player has three lives and gains points by 
                cutting the food and avoiding the fish. When the player holds the left mouse button and swipes 
                across the food or fish being launched across the screen, that game object is cut and disappears, 
                affecting the player’s points and lives according to what object was cut (or missed).
            </p>
                <p>Developed a recreation of the game Fruit Ninja in Unity, using Unity’s built in physics, input system, and
                    components, as well as C# scripts that control object spawning, launching, destroying, mouse tracking, and 
                    point system.</p>
                <p>The goal of the game is to try and cut the food items as they fly across the screen but avoid 
                    hitting the fish. The items can be cut by holding down the left mouse button and swiping over 
                    the game object. Cutting a food item gains the player one point, and missing one takes away three 
                    points. The player has three lives, and they lose a life if they cut a fish or if their points 
                    hit zero. Once the player runs out of lives, a game over screen pops up and the food stops launching. 
                    The player can then press the left mouse button to restart the game.</p>
                <p>The food and fish are launched across the screen from a randomly chosen spawn point (out of four possible points), 
                    towards a random target (of three choices), at a random frequency based on how long the game has ran, and 
                    with a random sprite and force. The sprite determines the effects that the game object has on the player's points 
                    and lives, and the range of possible forces depends on the distance the object has to travel. The randomization
                    increases the difficulty of the game and allows for the game to become more difficult over time.</p>
                <p>Collision detection is used to track points, lives, and when to destroy game objects, and the player can only cut
                    objects when swiping with the left mouse button pressed, as the collision component is disabled otherwise. The 
                    cursor that follows the mouse, with a sword sprite, collides with the game objects and triggers the points/lives 
                    to change, as well as destroying the object. A platform beneath the spawning platform collides with objects that 
                    were not cut and have fallen, and destroys them as well as deducting the points for a missed food item.</p>
