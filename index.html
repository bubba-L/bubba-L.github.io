            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>Hello! My name is Ben Larkin and I am a Computer Science major at Arcadia University. 
                I have experience working in Java and JavaFx, HTML and CSS, as well as many other 
                programming softwares.</p>

                <p>
                    Coding has given me a unique way to bring ideas to life, combining creativity with problem-solving in a way that feels natural to me. 
                    Even before I started coding in middle school, I was always experimenting, whether it was playing with Snap Circuits to build different electronic projects or taking things apart just to see how they worked 
                    and putting them back together. I have always enjoyed figuring things out, even when I was just exploring out of curiosity rather than solving an actual problem. 
                    Over time I realized that programming offers the same kind of freedom, allowing me to create and explore new ideas in ways I never expected. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    When I first took a coding class in school, I instantly enjoyed it and kept pushing myself to learn more. I continued taking programming courses throughout my education, including both AP Computer Science and AP Computer Science A in high school, each of which came with its own challenges, 
                    from heavy workloads to time-restricted assessments. But I've never been one to back down from a challenge. Whenever I got stuck, I turned to online resources like YouTube or programming forums to troubleshoot and expand my understanding.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Coding has become more than just a subject I study, it's something I do for fun. 
                    I like creating scripts and automation tools that make my life easier, improving my PC experience, and exploring new ways to solve problems through code. 
                </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Unitrade</strong> is a concept website developed as a class project, where our group was tasked with 
                coming up with an original idea rather than creating a fully functional site. Designed as a platform for 
                university students to buy and sell used school supplies, the website is purely interactive, allowing users 
                to navigate pages and input text but without storing data or enabling actual transactions. Our team of four 
                collaborated to ensure a cohesive design and user experience, with each member focusing on specific sections 
                while providing mutual support and feedback. I contributed to the development of the <strong>start page</strong>, 
                <strong>home page</strong>, and <strong>settings page</strong>, while my groupmates worked on other sections, 
                with all of us reviewing each other's work to maintain consistency across the site.

            <h2>Board of Community Assistance Project</h2>
            <h3>Summer 2023</h3>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://www.umtownship.org/government/authorities-boards-commissions/board-of-community-assistance/" target="_blank">Board of Community Assistance (BCA)</a> is an organization in Upper Merion Township 
                that was established in 2013 through a partnership with the Valley Forge Casino Resort. 
                Its primary purpose was to provide financial assistance through grants to nonprofit organizations 
                that benefited the residents of the township. The BCA also offered scholarships to high school students 
                who planned to attend post-secondary education or training.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As part of my effort to give back to the community, I worked on a project to help close the "digital divide" 
                in Upper Merion Township. This divide affected those who were unfamiliar with or anxious about using technology, 
                often leading to barriers in accessing essential services and staying connected. To address this, I offered free technology 
                help at the Community Center. I set up a help desk twice a week from May to August, providing one-on-one support for residents 
                with common technology issues. Additionally, I created printed guides that addressed frequently asked questions and problems. 
                This initiative aimed to ensure that everyone in the community, regardless of their comfort with technology, 
                could navigate the increasingly digital world.
